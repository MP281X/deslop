## Validation

| Changed files                 | Exact command                               |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Only Markdown files changed   | `vp run fix`                                |
| Any non-Markdown file changed | `vp run fix && vp run check && vp run test` |

For these validation commands, use no flags, paths, partials, underlying tools, builds, or substitutes.

## Data policy

- Releases are linear and squash-merged. Apply data changes at every merged pull request.
- Local data is disposable. Preserve production data only from the immediately previous release; delete obsolete data.
- Persist only irreducible canonical data and infer the rest.
